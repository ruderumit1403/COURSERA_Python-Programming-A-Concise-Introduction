"""
Problem 2_6:
Let's continue with our simulation of dice by rolling two of them. This time
each die can come up with a number from 1 to 6, but you have two of them. The
result or outcome is taken to be the sum of the pips on the two dice. Write a 
program that will roll 2 dice and produce the outcome. This time let's roll 
the two dice 100 times. Print the outcomes one outcome per line.
